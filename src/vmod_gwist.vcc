$Module gwist 3 Example VMOD

DESCRIPTION
===========

The gwist (Go Where I Send Thee) VMOD provide a simple solution to a
recurring problem: creating throwaway backends. Backend created this way are
cached for a configurable time after which they'll be discarded.

Please be aware that this vmod is not to be used for heavy duty as the backends
are stored in a linked-list, hence search is done linearly.

$Event vmod_event
$Function BACKEND backend(PRIV_VCL, PRIV_TASK, STRING host, STRING port)

Looks for an non-expired backend with the same host:port combination, and
creates one if none is found. gwist will pick the first ip available.

It must be only called, as the other functions below,
from a vcl_backend_* function.

If `host` can't be resolved to an IP, no backend is returned.

$Function BACKEND backend4(PRIV_VCL, PRIV_TASK, STRING host, STRING port)

Same as ``backend``, but only resolves to IPv4 addresses.

$Function BACKEND backend6(PRIV_VCL, PRIV_TASK, STRING host, STRING port)

Same as ``backend``, but only resolves to IPv6 addresses.

$Function BACKEND backend_num(PRIV_VCL, PRIV_TASK, STRING host, STRING port)

Same as ``backend``, but doesn't attempt DNS resolution. It's faster, but host
must be an IP (v4 or v6).

$Function VOID    ttl(PRIV_VCL, INT ttl)

Changes the period during which backends are cached (default is 10 seconds).

Calling this function will only affect newly created backends, and if ttl is
equal or less than 0, backends won't be cached.
